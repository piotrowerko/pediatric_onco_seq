# Pediatric Onco Seq

**Pediatric Onco Seq** is a project focused on developing a machine learning model to analyze genetic sequences and identify specific mutations or markers associated with pediatric cancers. Leveraging publicly available genomic data, this project aims to assist in the early detection and characterization of mutations that are relevant to childhood oncology, with a potential for supporting diagnostic and research efforts in pediatric cancer genomics.

## Project Goals
- Gather and preprocess genomic data from databases like NCBI (GenBank)
- Implement a machine learning model (using PyTorch) to identify cancer-specific genetic markers in pediatric populations
- Evaluate model accuracy and relevance for practical applications in pediatric oncology

## Getting Started
To begin using this project, you will need:
- A valid API key for accessing data from NCBI
- Python packages: `biopython`, `torch`, `pandas`, `numpy`

This project is in its early stages, and contributions are welcome!
